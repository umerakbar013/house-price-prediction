# house-price-prediction
internship task 

Task Objective
To predict house prices based on property features such as square footage (area), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location using regression models.

Dataset Used
Source: Kaggle â€“ House Price Prediction Dataset

Columns used: Area (Square Footage), Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Price

Format: CSV file (data.csv)

 Models Applied
Gradient Boosting Regressor (used for final evaluation)

Alternative model (optional): Linear Regression


Key Results and Findings
The Gradient Boosting model performed well on predicting house prices.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $170,212

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $983,481

Predictions closely followed actual prices with some deviation in high-priced properties.

Visualizations
Actual vs Predicted Price scatter plot was used to assess model performance visually.

Error metrics suggest the model can be useful with further tuning or additional features (like location, year built, etc.).
